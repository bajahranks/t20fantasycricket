            <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy

        <p class="mb-10">
            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT")
            feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
            browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing
            and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals
            or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard
            for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in

            California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently
