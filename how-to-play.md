## How to Play

### Leagues
The first screen you will see after logging in is the leagues screen. Here you can join existing leagues.

### Teams
Once you have joined a league, you will see the teams screen. The teams screen is made up of three sections:
1. The team stats section
2. The team players section
3. The view leaderboard section

The team stats section contains the number of players in the team, the total value, the total points and the 
current rank of the team. 

The team players section contains the players in the team. On the first load, this section will be empty. To add
players to your team, go to the market screen and select the players you want to add. See the market section for
more details. Once players have been added to your team, you will see a player card for each player in the team.
The player card contains the player image, name, team, type, current value and points while the player is in your 
team (This is important to note). Tapping on the player will display a modal that contains the player's 
performance for the current season and a button to remove the player from your team.

The view leaderboard section contains a button that will direct you to the leaderboard screen. See the leaderboard
section for more details.

### Market
The market screen is where you will add players to your team. The market screen is made up of three sections:
1. The filter section
2. The player list section
3. The team details section

The filter section contains a search bar, a sort menu, filter by type and filter by team. The search bar allows 
you to search for players by name. The sort menu allows you to sort the players by name, price and points. The
type and team filters are multiple select filters and can be combined to narrow down the results.

The player list section contains the list of players available. The player card contains the player image, name,
team, type, current value and points. Tapping on the player will add the player to the team screen but will not save 
the player to your team. Long press on the player will display a modal that contains the player's performance 
for the current season.

The team details section contains the number of players in the team, the remaining budget, the number of transfers
remaining and the save button. The save button will save the team to your league. Once the tournament for a specific
league has started, the save button will be disabled depending on the game situation.

### Leaderboard
The leaderboard screen is where you will see the leaderboard for the current season. The leaderboard screen is made
up of two sections:
1. The overall leaderboard section
2. The leaderboard by round section

The overall leaderboard section will display the position of each user for the current season. The leaderboard by
round section will display the position of each user for each round of the current season.

### Profile
On the profile screen you can update your name, change your password, view documentation, sign out and delete your account.

## Game Rules
A team can only have 11 players.

In between rounds a user can make up to four transfers.

Player values fluctuate between rounds based on their performance in the previous round compared to the 
performance of other players in the that round. If a team value exceeds the maximum value, at the end of a round
the team will not record points for the next round if it is not resolved by the start of the next round.
